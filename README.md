&nbsp; Some insights on how churn is correlated with other variables:
* &nbsp; Churn is positively correlated with Complain.
* &nbsp; Churn is negatively correlated with Tenure, DaySinceLastOrder, and CashbackAmount.
* &nbsp; For the customers who have a Complain, PreferedOrderCat (Preferred order category of customer in last month) has a relatively high correlation with Churn.
